# Assignment 2
This assignment is a basic Java excersize using object oriented programming concepts. A more detailed explanation of this assignment is avialable in the [assignment information file](./info.html).

The Eclipse IDE or the standard `javac` compiler may be used to compile the source code. For example, to compile `HW2Tester.java`, execute `javac HW2Tester.java` in this directory. A classfile named `HW2Tester.class` will be created which can be run in the terminal using `java HW2Tester`.

This project was made for the [Advanced Java Programming (COP 3252)](http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/cop3252/) taught by [Bob Myers](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/department/faculty/myers/) at Florida State University.
