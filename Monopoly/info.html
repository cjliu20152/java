<h2>
Assignment X - Game Project</h2>
<b>Due</b>: Wed, Apr 25

<h3>Objective</h3>

Programming in Java involves not only understanding the syntactic rules 
and constructs of the language, but also the ability to research the 
libraries that are needed for a task, as well as organizing good 
object-oriented design.  The Java API is very large and has many pre-built 
features. After this assignment, you will have some experience looking 
into existing Java libraries and designing a small program using 
object-oriented techniques.

<h3>Task</h3>

For this assignment, you will design and implement a game in Java.  This
project is to be done in groups of 2 people each. The final 
deliverables will be due at the end of the term.

<br>

<h3>Details</h3>

<ol>
<li>You may choose from a variety of board games or 1-player solo games
<a href="hwxfiles/gamelist.html">listed here</a>, or you may request a 
game that is not on the list, but it <i>must be approved in advance</i>. 
The idea is for various groups to do different games -- but to ensure 
that more groups will get one of their first choices, we'll allow at 
most two groups to do any one specific game.

 <ul>
 <li>Send me an e-mail (myers@cs.fsu.edu) indicating who is working 
     together, as well as what game you want to do (you should indicate 
     a second choice, in case your first is already taken).  I will 
     update choices on the linked chart as choices are made -- first 
     come first serve.
 </li>

 <li>If you want to request a game that is not already on the list, 
  include this in your e-mail, along with a description of 
  the game and/or link to online instructions for the game.  
  Essentially, I want to ensure that each group is doing a 
  game that is of an appropriate level.  (Tic-tac-toe, for example, is too 
  simple, and we've already done a version of it).
 </li>

 <li>A good choice of game should be one that has choices to make 
by players, and at least 2 or 3 GUI controls.  For 
example, a game like Chutes and Ladders would be a weak choice, because 
the only player control is to roll the dice -- there are no 
other controls, and no actual choices to make.</li>
 </ul>

<br>
</li>

<li>The minimum requirement is to write a game with a graphic interface 
as a Java application, which can be played by 1 or more human 
players on the computer. It should have an intuitive and usable 
interface, and it should implement the standard set of rules for your 
chosen game. In the event that you have a game with some rule 
variations, you should include information in your README file 
(described below) that clarifies what version of the rules you are 
implementing.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><b>General Guidelines for Grading</b>: Since you have the freedom to 
implement the design, grading for this project will be somewhat 
subjective.  However, here are some guidelines I will be using:
 <ul>
 <li>Programs will be judged on 3 primary factors -- Correct rules 
     implementation, user interface (GUI), and class/code design
 <br>&nbsp;</br>
 </li>

 <li><b>To qualify for an A</b>:  Rules of game implemented correctly, 
  playable game, well-designed GUI interface that is intuitive for 
  the user, program fairly robust (erroneous inputs handled, for 
  instance), well-designed object-oriented code. At least one <i>extra</i> 
  feature, that goes beyond the basic game rules (Examples: multiple 
  versions of rules implemented, a save-game feature, etc. If you're not 
  sure whether a certain feature would satisfy this, ask).
 <br>&nbsp;</li>

 <li><b>To qualify for a B</b>:  Rules of game implemented 
  mostly correctly (perhaps a few flaws, but fixable), usable GUI, 
  playable game, reasonably good code design. 
 <br>&nbsp;</li>

 <li><b>To qualify for a C</b>: The main aspects of gameplay implemented 
  correctly, so that the game is more or less playable, even if there 
  are some flaws or other rules that didn't get implemented.  Some  
  sort of GUI (even if rough around the edges, and not as user-friendly).
 <br>&nbsp;</li>

 <li>Due to the fact that some games are harder to implement than others, 
  the level of difficulty of implementing a game will factor in as well 
  when judging rules implementations. (For example, chess has more 
  complicated rules than checkers).
 <br>&nbsp;
 </li>

 <li>Roughly, the grading breakdown is:
  <ul>
  <li>Rules implementation / gameplay -- 30%</li>
  <li>User interface (GUI) -- 30%</li>
  <li>class/code design -- 30%</li>
  <li>Some extra feature(s), beyond normal game rules -- 10%</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
 </li>

 <li>Notes on these breakdown items:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Rules</b><br>
      Your game needs to adhere to the standard set of rules for the 
      chosen game. If not a standard well-known game (like chess), make 
      sure to provide rules or a link to the rules in your README file, 
      along with any rule variations you are implementing.
  </li>

  <li><b>User interface</b><br>
      This will be judged on the overall user experience / user 
      friendliness. Strive for intuitive and appropriate GUI controls. 
      Avoid redundancy (extra clicks just for the sake of having extra 
      controls, buttons, etc).  Also strive for a more attractive and 
      clean-looking interface that an average person would WANT to use.

      <br>Also, make sure your game runs on a reasonable screen/window 
         size (like a standard desktop or laptop screen).
  </li>

  <li><b>Code design</b><br>
      Code design will be judged on appropriateness of object-oriented 
      design, modifiability, readability, easiness to debug. Avoid 
      brute-force copy/paste style coding -- this leads to tedious code
      that is hard to read, modify, and debug.  (When designing a game 
      like this, you want to have code that would make it easy to add new 
      features in the next version, for example).
  </li>
  </ul>
 </li>

<!--
 <li>Overall, for a better grade, implement a better program!</li>
-->
 </ul> 
<br>&nbsp;</li>


<li><b>Guidelines for researching resources</b>
 <ul>
 <li>As we've been primarily using Java SE 8 in this class, make sure 
   your code compiles and runs with the latest update of the Java 8 SDK 
   (Standard Dev Kit)</li>

 <li>You may use any of the Java libraries in the JavaSE 8 API (unless 
  you happen to find a package like <tt>java.game.monopoly</tt>, for 
  instance).</li>

 <li>It would probably be a good idea to look at many other GUI examples 
  (including the ones we've done in class) and look at the tutorials on 
  the java.sun web site (now on oracle), to help you find other 
  techniques and tips for implementing graphic interfaces with 
  event handling</li>

 <li>If you find a resource that gives you some ideas -- and especially if 
  you model a portion of your code after another example -- be sure to 
  cite your source in your documentation</li>

 <li>The coding, however, <b>must be yours</b>! You are to implement 
  your own game logic (i.e. you may <b>not</b> just find an existing 
  implementation of a game and use code found on web searches).</li>

 <li>Any actual Java code in your program needs to be generated by you 
     (and not auto-generated, for example, by NetBeans).</li>

 <li>For GUI components and layouts, you may use Swing libraries, or 
     you may use Java FX (i.e. embedded XML for the components and 
     layouts).  If you choose to use the latter, you may have some XML 
     files generated by the SceneBuilder tool, but again, any Java code 
     must be yours.</li>

 <li>You may use icons, graphics pictures, sounds, etc that you find
  online. If and when possible, cite your source, and be sure to pay
  attention to any copyright notices regarding such resources. (Example: 
  If you choose a solitaire card game, it would be a good idea to find 
  image files of cards, for a nicer interface -- it's best to find 
  public domain images for this sort of thing). </li>

 </ul>

<br>&nbsp;</li>


<li><b>Extra Credit Opportunities</b> -- I'm leaving this wide open.  
There will be plenty of chances to earn extra credit on this assignment. 
Anything above and beyond the minimum requirements can be done for extra 
credit. Be sure to list anything extra you do in your README file, so I 
know to look for it. Here are just a few possible things you could try, 
just to give you some ideas (but certainly not limited to these):
 <ul>

 <li>Save/Open feature, for saving games in progress</li>

 <li>For a game with rule variations, implement the ability to play using 
  one or more of the variations (or a menu to choose rule settings, if 
  appropriate).</li>

 <li>More creative and fun visual layouts, possibly incorporating graphics, 
  sounds, animations, etc.</li>

 </ul>

<h3>
Deliverables:</h3>

You should pack all relevant files for your 
assignment into one jar file (named <tt>hwx.jar</tt>).  The jar 
file should contain:
<ul>
<li>All necessary .class files and resource files that make your program 
 work</li>

<li>All source code files (.java files) for your program</li>

<li>A <tt>README</tt> file (this can be in text format or in html 
format) that contains any extra documentation for your project. This
should include
 <ul>
 <li>Any details regarding instructions for the game that are not obvious 
 from the set of standard known instructions</li>
 <li>A description of how to use the interface</li>
 <li>Any other important details about your implementation, how to run 
the program, etc</li>
 <li>Descriptions of any extra features implemented</li>
 <li>A description of the separation of work between partners (who was 
     responsible for what pieces of the program).</li>
 </ul>
</li>

</ul>

Your <tt>jar</tt> file should also be runnable.  This means that if you 
wrote it as an application, I should be able to play your game with the 
command:
<pre>
  java -jar hwx.jar
</pre>

Possible exception: If you happen to do anything that involves mulitple 
programs (like a client/server implementation), then you can pack those 
as separate runnable jar files, then put those into the main archive.  
Make sure any such details are noted in your README.


<p>Submit your assignment via the Canvas submission links. 
Only ONE student in the group needs to physically submit the file,
but make sure both names are included in your submission.  
<b>Remember to INCLUDE YOUR SOURCE CODE in your jar file!</b>
