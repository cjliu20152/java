<h2>
Assignment #1</h2>
<b>Due</b>: Thurs, Jan 25, by 11:59 PM

<h3>Objective</h3>
This assignment is intended to help you gain practice with basic Java 
syntax, including basic procedural programming, functions, arrays, and 
console I/O.

<h3>Task</h3>

<p>Do the following three exercises, each in a different file.  (These 
are based on textbook exercises in chapters 5, 6, and 7).

<!--
 5.20, 6.26, 
and 7.17).
-->

<hr>


<br>Your filenames should be
<ul>
<li><tt>Pi.java</tt></li>
<li><tt>Reverse.java</tt></li>
<li><tt>DiceStats.java</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>To do the console input for these exercises, use the 
<tt>java.util.Scanner</tt> class.   For random numbers in the last 
exercise, you can use class <tt>java.util.Random</tt>.

<p>Declare any methods you write to be <tt>public</tt> and 
<tt>static</tt>.  You may also use the <tt>java.lang.Math</tt> class in 
these programs, where needed.  You may assume correct type of user input 
in these problems.

<h3>Exercise 1</h3>

Filename: <b><tt>Pi.java</tt></b>

<p>Based on Exercise 5.20

<p>Calculate the value of <i>pi</i> from the infinite series
<pre>
 <i>pi</i> = 4 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + 4/9 - 4/11 + ...
</pre>
Print a table that shows the value of <i>pi</i> approximated by 
computing one term of this series, by two terms, by three terms, and so 
on. Use default precision for output (i.e. do not set any decimal 
precision).

<p>Start by asking the user how many terms of the series to 
compute to, and then let the user enter the information.  Use this to 
print a table of the first N terms of the series (where N is the data 
entered by the user).  Assume the user's input will be a non-negative 
integer. (see sample output)

<h3>Exercise 2</h3>

Filename: <b><tt>Reverse.java</tt></b>

<p>Based on Exercise 6.26

<p>Write a method called <tt>reverseDigits</tt> that takes a long 
integer value and returns that number with its digits reversed. For 
example, given the value 7631, the method should return the value 1367 
(as a long integer).

<p>Write a <tt>main()</tt> routing that enters a loop, in which the user 
is prompted and allowed to enter any long integer (0 to exit the loop), 
and the <tt>reverseDigits</tt> method is used to compute and return the 
reversed number. Print this from the main routine.  See sample run 
below.

<h3>Sample Run</h3>
(Sample user input is underlined)

<pre>
 Please enter a long integer (0 to quit): <u>123456</u>

 The number reversed is: 654321

 Please enter a long integer (0 to quit): <u>8473625145</u>

 The number reversed is: 5415263748

 Please enter a long integer (0 to quit): <u>23456789</u>

 The number reversed is: 98765432

 Please enter a long integer (0 to quit): <u>123456789012345678</u>

 The number reversed is: 876543210987654321

 Please enter a long integer (0 to quit): <u>0</u>

 Goodbye!

<h3>Exercise 3</h3>

Filename: <b><tt>DiceStats.java</tt></b>

<p>Based on Exercise 7.17 from the textbook, but expanded

<p>Write a program that does the following:

<ol>
<li>Ask the user to enter how many dice will constitute one roll.
(This is based on the idea that different games require different
numbers of rolls for a "turn".  For example, in Yahtzee, you roll 5
dice.  In craps, you roll 2 dice.  Etc.) </li>

<li>Ask the user to enter how many rolls they would like to perform</li>

<li>Create and use an array to keep track of how many times each
possible dice sum appears.  (Essentially, you need a bunch of counters,
but how many will depend on how many dice are rolled per "turn".  For
example, 2 dice can come up with a total of 2 through 12.  But 3 dice
could yield a total of 3 through 18).
 <ul>
 <li>Hint: The idea of this array is to be a "frequency array", like in
     example 7.7 from the book</li>
 <li>Hint: How many counters will you need?  Well, the lowest possible
     total is the number of dice rolled (all 1s).  The highest possible
     total is all 6s, so (6 * number_of_dice).  Use this information to
     decide on the size of your frequency array.
 </ul>
</li>

<li>Use a loop to roll the specified number of dice the desired number
of times (and calculate the sum of each dice roll).  Use the array to
count and track the number of times each possible sum appears</li>

<li>Display the results in a table with 3 columns:
 <ol>
 <li>the die total</li>
 <li>the number of times that total appeared</li>
 <li>the percentage of the total rolls that this sum appeared</li>
 </ol>
 Compute and print the percentage to 2 decimal places.
</li>

</ol>

<h3>Compiling</h3>

Remember that the compile command is "javac", at the unix command 
prompt.  Compile your code on <tt><b>linprog.cs.fsu.edu</b></tt>, and 
then run your programs with the "java" command.

<h3>
Preparing for Submission:</h3>

Pack up your files into a single jar-file on 
<tt>linprog.cs.fsu.edu</tt> with the <b>jar</b> utility.  Here's the 
command:

<pre>
  jar cvf hw1.jar Pi.java Reverse.java DiceStats.java
</pre>

Or, if you have all your .java files for this one in a single directory 
(and no other .java files in that location) :
<pre>
  jar cvf hw1.jar *.java
</pre>

<h3>Submitting</h3>

I've created a Canvas submission link for the assignment.  On the 
Canvas course link, select "Assignments" from the menu, 
then click the "Assignment 1" link to get to the submission page.
