# Assignment 1
This assignment contains three basic Java excersizes focused on procedural programming, functions, arrays, and console I/O. A full explanation can be in the [assignment information file](./info.html).

The Eclipse IDE or the standard `javac` compiler may be used to compile the source code. For example, to compile `Pi.java`, execute `javac Pi.java` in this directory. A classfile named `Pi.class` will be created which can be run in the terminal using `java Pi`.

This project was made for the [Advanced Java Programming (COP 3252)](http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/cop3252/) taught by [Bob Myers](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/department/faculty/myers/) at Florida State University.
