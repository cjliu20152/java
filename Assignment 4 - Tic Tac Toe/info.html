<h2>
Assignment #4 - Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
<b>Due</b>:  Mon, Feb 26


<h3>Objective</h3>

Practice with classes in Java, including String libraries, command-line 
arguments, and inheritance techniques.

<h3>Task</h3>

<b>Write a Tic-Tac-Toe game</b>, which will be played and drawn with text 
characters on the console.  This assignment is based on exercise 8.19, but 
the specifications here will be more specific.

<br>
<hr>

<p>The main program should be in a class called <tt>TicTacToe</tt>, so 
this will have filename:
<ul>
<li>TicTacToe.java</li>
</ul>

You may build other classes, in other files. The design of this program is 
up to you. Everything will be packed up into a runnable jar file at the end.

<hr>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ol>
<li><b>Storage and setup</b>: You have the freedom to design this with as 
many or few classes as you like.  The game must begin with the 
<tt>main()</tt> method in class <tt>TicTacToe</tt>. You must use a 3 X 3 
two-dimensional array (member data of a class) to store the game board 
information.  (You can choose the type of storage).
<br><i>Suggestion</i>: Try to design your classes for re-usability. For 
example, if you were to port your game logic to a GUI interface in the 
future, how easy would it be?
<br><i>Another suggestion</i>: Your main game loop will be easier if you 
set up base class variables for any generic type of player, then attach 
objects for the player types for any given game.  You can make good use 
of polymorphism here.

<br>&nbsp;
</li>

<li><b>Player Options</b>:  You should allow the options of human and/or 
computer players.  This will be controlled through command line options 
when starting the program.  First player has X, second player has O.  The 
command format for player options is:
<pre>
  java TicTacToe [-c [1|2]]
</pre>
The "-c" option indicates computer player(s).  The optional "1|2" allows 
the user to specify which player will be the computer player. Omitting the 
"-c" option means two human players (the default mode).  Here are the 
possible combinations:
<pre>
  java TicTacToe	// two human players
  java TicTacToe -c	// two computer players
  java TicTacToe -c 1	// computer is player 1, human player 2
  java TicTacToe -c 2	// human player 1, computer player 2
</pre>
If the command is invalid usage (illegal options), print a usage message, 
like:
<pre>
  Usage:  java TicTacToe [-c [1|2]]
</pre>
</li>

<li><b>Board output and player interface</b>: The output of the board 
should be in ascii text format.  It needs to be user friendly.  When 
asking a human player for a move, let them type in just the number of a 
square. Whenever an invalid cell is chosen by a human player (already 
filled, or out of range), print an error message and have them re-enter.  
Player 1 will always be 'X' and will go first (whether human or 
computer).  Player 2 will always be 'O'.  A sample of suggested output 
appears farther down the page.
<br>&nbsp;
</li>


<li><b>Computer Player Rules</b>:  The computer player must play to a 
certain level of intelligence (i.e. not just random moves).  Here are the 
decisions that a computer player must implement, in this order of 
priority:
 <ol>
 <li>If a winning move is available, take it.</li>
 <li>If the opponent is threatening a winning play, block it. (Note that 
     if the opponent has two winning plays, only one can be blocked).</li>
 <li>If the center square is available, take it</li>
 <li>Else choose randomly between any remaining squares</li>
 </ol>
Notice that with the above logic, it <i>will</i> be possible to beat a 
computer player.

<br>&nbsp;
</li>

<li><b>End of Game</b>: If somebody wins, determine and print out which 
player was the winner.  If the game ends with no winner, print out that it 
was a draw.
<br>&nbsp;
</li>

<li><b>Randomness</b>: Whenever the computer player has to make a random 
choice, each of the possible choices <i>must</i> have an equal chance of 
being picked. (This means that if it's a choice of 3 squares, you should 
pick a random number in a range of 3, etc.)
<br>&nbsp;
</li>

</ol>

<h3>Some Suggested Libraries</h3>
<ul>
<li><tt>String</tt></li>
<li><tt>StringBuilder</tt></li>
<li><tt>java.util.Random</tt></li>
<li><tt>java.util.Scanner</tt></li>
<li><tt>java.lang.Integer</tt></li>
</ul>

Also notice that there's a good opportunity to use inheritance and 
polymorphism in the game play.  (Hint:  Create a <tt>Player</tt> class and 
then derive classes to represent the different types of players.  We'll 
talk about this technique in class.)

<h3>Sample output format</h3>

(user input is underlined)

<pre>
Game Board:                Positions:

   |   |                    1 | 2 | 3 
-----------                -----------
   |   |                    4 | 5 | 6 
-----------                -----------
   |   |                    7 | 8 | 9 

Player 1, please enter a move (1-9): <u>5</u>



Game Board:                Positions:

   |   |                    1 | 2 | 3 
-----------                -----------
   | X |                    4 | 5 | 6 
-----------                -----------
   |   |                    7 | 8 | 9 

Player 2 (computer) chooses position 7



Game Board:                Positions:

   |   |                    1 | 2 | 3 
-----------                -----------
   | X |                    4 | 5 | 6 
-----------                -----------
 O |   |                    7 | 8 | 9 

Player 1, please enter a move (1-9): <u>3</u>



Game Board:                Positions:

   |   | X                  1 | 2 | 3 
-----------                -----------
   | X |                    4 | 5 | 6 
-----------                -----------
 O |   |                    7 | 8 | 9 

</pre>

<hr>


<h3>Extra Credit</h3>

Add a command line option "-a", which stands for "advanced".  This option, 
if used, makes any computer players take their turns with more advanced 
logic, as follows:
<ol>
<li>If a winning move is available, take it.</li>
<li>If the opponent is threatening a winning play, block it.</li>
<li>Determine which squares can be played that will not eventually result 
in a loss, and choose randomly between them</li>
</ol>
In other words, on the advanced setting, a computer player will 
<i>always</i> play smart enough to <b>not lose</b>. Theoretically, any 
game on this setting should result in a tie (as long as a human player is 
playing "smart", too).

<p>Sample command line usage:
<pre>
  java TicTacToe -c 1 -a	// player 1 is computer on advanced setting
</pre>
Note that the -a option only makes sense if the -c option is used.  If you 
do the extra credit, the usage message would now be:
<pre>
  Usage:  java TicTacToe [-c [1|2] [-a]]
</pre>

<hr>


<h3>Submitting:</h3>

<p>Pack your class files <b>and</b> source code into a fully
runnable JAR file called <b><tt>hw4.jar</tt></b>.  
I should be able to run your game from the jar file with the command:

<pre>
  java -jar hw4.jar
</pre>

Submit this jar file through the HW 4 submission link on the Canvas
course page.
