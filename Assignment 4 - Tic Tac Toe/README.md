# Assignment 4 - TicTacToe
This is a Java implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe. A more detailed explanation of this assignment is avialable in the [assignment information file](./info.html).

The Eclipse IDE or the standard `javac` compiler may be used to compile the source code. To compile `TicTacToe.java`, execute `javac TicTacToe.java` in this directory. A classfile named `TicTacToe.class` will be created which can be run in the terminal using `java TicTacToe`.

TicTacToe can be run with two human players, two AIs, one of each, or with advanced AI players. Specify AI players with the flag `-c` followed by which player the AI will control. For example, `-c` will set both players to AI control, `-c 1` will set Player 1 to AI control, and `-c 2` will set Player 2 to AI control. Specify advanced AI using the `-a` flag. For example, `-c 1 -a` will set Player 1 to advanced AI control. More details can be found in the [assignment information file](./info.html).

This project was made for the [Advanced Java Programming (COP 3252)](http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/cop3252/) taught by [Bob Myers](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/department/faculty/myers/) at Florida State University.
