# Assignment 5 - File Directory Search
This is a Java implementation of a directory search/list, similar to the `ls` Unix command. A more detailed explanation of this assignment is avialable in the [assignment information file](./info.html).

The Eclipse IDE or the standard `javac` compiler may be used to compile the source code. To compile `DirSearch.java`, execute `javac DirSearch.java` in this directory. A classfile named `DirSearch.class` will be created which can be run in the terminal using `java DirSearch`.

DirSearch can be used with the following parameters and flags: `java DirSearch [directory_name] [-a | -l | -s]` where `a` represents alphabetical sorting, `l` represents "last time modified" sorting, and `s` represents file-size sorting. More details can be found in the [assignment information file](./info.html).

This project was made for the [Advanced Java Programming (COP 3252)](http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/cop3252/) taught by [Bob Myers](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/department/faculty/myers/) at Florida State University.
