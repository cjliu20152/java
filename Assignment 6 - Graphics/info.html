<h2>
Assignment #6</h2>
<b>Due</b>: Tues, March 27

<h3>Objective</h3>
This assignment will help you gain basic practice with Graphics and Java2D 
classes.

<h3>Task</h3>

<p>Do the following 3 exercises, each involving the use of 
painting with Graphics and/or Graphics2D class features.  Note that each 
of these should be set up like the examples we saw in class -- the 
drawings should be done on a custom JPanel that is embedded as the 
content area of a JFrame.

<hr>

<br>Filenames should be
<ul>
<li><tt>Triangles.java</tt></li>
<li><tt>Snowman.java</tt></li>
<li><tt>ScreenSaver.java</tt></li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol> 

<li><b><tt>Triangles.java</tt></b> -- Write an application that draws 
random triangles. Write your application so that the drawing is done on 
a JPanel, embedded in a JFrame with starting size 500 x 500.  (Note that 
JFrames can be resized by the user, just like normal windows in standard 
computer applications). On your JPanel, you will draw 5 random 
triangles, each filled with a randomly chosen color. To choose a random 
color, choose each of the RGB values randomly (range 0-255).  Use class 
<tt>GeneralPath</tt> to create the triangles, and method <tt>fill</tt> 
from class <tt>Graphics2D</tt> to draw them.

<p>The triangle endpoints should be chosen chosen so that they could be 
any valid points within the JPanel.  Note that this is not always in a 
range of 500 x 500 -- if the application frame is expanded, the panel area 
will be larger.  Do your drawing in method <tt>paintComponent</tt>. 
(Notice that this means that refreshes to the panel will result in new 
random trangles.  For example, resize the window and the internal 
components will be redrawn, because <tt>paintComponent</tt> will be called 
again).

<br>&nbsp;
</li>

<li><b><tt>Snowman.java</tt></b>: Write an application that draws a 
snowman. The snowman's exact size and position will be based on given 
proportions and centered in the current JPanel.  Details:
<ul>
<li>Build your application as a JPanel embedded in a JFrame.  Set 
the frame's starting size as 600 x 400. The snowman is drawn on the 
JPanel</li>

<li>The main body of the snowman should consist of three circles, 
sitting on top of each other</li>

<li>The bottom circle takes up half of the snowman's height. The middle 
and top circle take up 2/3 and 1/3 of the remaining height, 
respectively</li>

<li>Each of these circles is drawn with a random color</li>

<li>The full snowman should take up 3/4 of the panel's height, and it 
should be centered horizontally and vertically in the panel. (Note: This 
means the exact locations and sizes of circles will change if the panel 
is resized)</li>

<li>The snowman should have two eyes (black) drawn in the top circle, 
aligned proportionally somewhere near the top of the head (i.e. where 
eyes would naturally go)</li>

<li>The snowman should have two arms (black) drawn coming out of 
the top part of the middle circle.  They should just be lines that stick 
out from the middle "body" section, angled upwards.  Draw these so that 
they adjust proportionally as the window is resized.  (They should 
always fully appear in the actual panel!)</li>

<li>NO portion of the drawing should ever leave the viewable area of the 
panel</li>
</ul>
Sample screenshots, based on different window sizes:
<ul>
<li><a href="h6files/snowman1.png">Screenshot 1</a></li>
<li><a href="h6files/snowman2.png">Screenshot 2</a></li>
</ul>

<br>&nbsp;
</li>

<li><b><tt>ScreenSaver.java</tt></b>: Write an application that simulates a 
screen saver. The application will randomly draw 50 ovals to the screen 
(various sizes and locations), then it should refresh every 1 second.
<p>For the drawing of the ovals, follow these rules:
 <ul>
 <li>Draw on a <tt>JPanel</tt> imbedded in a <tt>JFrame</tt>, as before, 
 and set the starting frame size to 800 x 600.</li>
 <li>Each run through <tt>paintComponent</tt> should draw 50 random 
     ovals, which must show up within the JPanel boundaries</li>
 <li>For each oval, pick a random color</li>
 <li>For each oval, pick a random paint brush thickness between 1 and 
     10</li>
 <li>For each oval, pick a random location within the panel, and a 
   random size (height/width).  Note that the chosen height/width need 
   to ensure that the oval remains WITHIN the current JPanel.  i.e. 
   your ovals should be fully viewable on the currently shown panel 
   (the only exception is that your ovals might <b>slightly</b> overlap 
   the panel boundaries due to paintbrush thickness)</li>
 </ul>
<p>For the refresh of the screen, you'll need to use class 
   <tt>javax.swing.Timer</tt>. This class sets up a timer event so that 
   the <tt>actionPerformed</tt> gets called after a given fixed time 
   interval.  In your <tt>actionPerformed</tt> method, you can simply 
   call <tt>repaint()</tt> on your panel, and a new set of ovals will 
   be drawn.
<p>See this example for an illustration on the usage of the Timer class:
<a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/cop3252/notes/examples/gui/Ball.java">
Bouncing Ball</a>
</ul>

<br>&nbsp;
</li>


<li><b>General</b>
 <ul>
 <li>Any member data (static and instance variables) of classes you 
     write should be <tt>private</tt></li>
 <li>Our in-class examples illustrated usage of several Java2D and 
     drawing concepts, such as the libraries GeneralPath, Color, JPanel 
     inside a JFrame, paintbrush/line thickness settings, drawing 
     various shapes -- make sure to refer to these, and the related 
     libraries in the Java API!</li>
 <li>Other functions you will find helpful are <tt>getHeight()</tt> and 
     <tt>getWidth()</tt>, part of every Swing component (inherited from 
     class <tt>JComponent</tt>)</li>
 <li>Make sure your code is appropriately documented and easy to read</li>   

 </ul>
</li>
</ol>

works

<h3>
Submitting:</h3>

Pack up your files (including source code, as always) into a single 
jar-file called "hw6.jar".  Since this contains three programs in it, 
you do NOT need to make it runnable.  Just make sure that when it's 
unpacked, the following commands will run the executable programs:

<pre>
  java Triangles
  java Snowman
  java ScreenSaver
</pre>
 
As usual, submit your jar file through the Blackboard submission link.

<!--


E-mail this jar file to me (<b>myers@cs.fsu.edu</b>) by the due date.  
Your e-mail subject should be <b>HW6-SUBMIT</b>.  Include your name and 
section in the e-mail body.  Please only submit ONCE, unless you make a 
mistake and need to correct it (before the due date) -- and minimize 
this.  Only the last submission will be graded.
