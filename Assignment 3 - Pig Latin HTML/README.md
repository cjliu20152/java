# Assignment 3 - Pig Latin Web Translator
This is a Java string manipulation program which converts web-pages to pig latin. A more detailed explanation of this assignment is avialable in the [assignment information file](./info.html).

The Eclipse IDE or the standard `javac` compiler may be used to compile the source code. To compile `WebToPigLatin.java`, execute `javac WebToPigLatin.java` in this directory. A classfile named `WebToPigLatin.class` will be created which can be run in the terminal using `java WebToPigLatin`.

The test web page provided can be used to demonstrate the pig latin translations. For example, executing `WebToPigLatin.class test_input.html out.html` will save a new web-page with the translated version to `out.html`.

This project was made for the [Advanced Java Programming (COP 3252)](http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/cop3252/) taught by [Bob Myers](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/department/faculty/myers/) at Florida State University.
